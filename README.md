Checkd is a todo app that uses Core Data to persistent data to device. The `CoreDataStack` type handles all the Core Data setup.  Business logic is seperated from the view by using the MVVM design pattern.  Repositories are used to seperate the data layer from the view model. The Coordinator Pattern is used to handle navigation events.
