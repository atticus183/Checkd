Checkd is a todo app that uses Core Data to persistent data to device. TheÂ `CoreDataStack` type handles all the Core Data setup. Business logic is separated from the view by using the MVVM design pattern. Repositories are used to separate the data layer from the view model. The Coordinator Pattern is used to handle navigation events.
